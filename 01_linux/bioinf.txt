Bioinformatics (/ˌbaɪ.oʊˌɪnfərˈmætɪks/) is an interdisciplinary field of science that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, especially when the data sets are large and complex. 
Bioinformatics uses biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, data science, computer programming, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data. 
This process can sometimes be referred to as computational biology, however the distinction between the two terms is often disputed. 
To some, the term computational biology refers to building and using models of biological systems.
Computational, statistical, and computer programming techniques have been used for computer simulation analyses of biological queries. 
They include reused specific analysis "pipelines", particularly in the field of genomics, such as by the identification of genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). 
These pipelines are used to better understand the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (especially in agricultural species), or differences between populations. 
Bioinformatics also includes proteomics, which aims to understand the organizational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences.[1]
Image and signal processing allow the extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. It aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed mutations. 
Bioinformatics includes text mining of biological literature and the development of biological and gene ontologies to organize and query biological data. 
It also plays a role in the analysis of gene and protein expression and regulation. 
Bioinformatic tools aid in comparing, analyzing, and interpreting genetic and genomic data and in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. 
At a more integrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important part of systems biology. 
In structural biology, it aids in the simulation and modeling of DNA,[2] RNA,[2][3] proteins[4] as well as biomolecular interactions.[5][6][7][8]

The first definition of the term bioinformatics was coined by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1970, to refer to the study of information processes in biotic systems.[9][10][11][12][13] 
This definition placed bioinformatics as a field parallel to biochemistry (the study of chemical processes in biological systems).[10]
Bioinformatics and computational biology involved the analysis of biological data, particularly DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. 
The field of bioinformatics experienced explosive growth starting in the mid-1990s, driven largely by the Human Genome Project and by rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology.
Analyzing biological data to produce meaningful information involves writing and running software programs that use algorithms from graph theory, artificial intelligence, soft computing, data mining, image processing, and computer simulation. 
The algorithms in turn depend on theoretical foundations such as discrete mathematics, control theory, system theory, information theory, and statistics.

There has been a tremendous advance in speed and cost reduction since the completion of the Human Genome Project, with some labs able to sequence over 100,000 billion bases each year, and a full genome can be sequenced for $1,000 or less.[14]
Computers became essential in molecular biology when protein sequences became available after Frederick Sanger determined the sequence of insulin in the early 1950s.[15][16] 
Comparing multiple sequences manually turned out to be impractical. 
Margaret Oakley Dayhoff, a pioneer in the field,[17] compiled one of the first protein sequence databases, initially published as books[18] as well as methods of sequence alignment and molecular evolution.[19] 
Another early contributor to bioinformatics was Elvin A. Kabat, who pioneered biological sequence analysis in 1970 with his comprehensive volumes of antibody sequences released online with Tai Te Wu between 1980 and 1991.[20]
In the 1970s, new techniques for sequencing DNA were applied to bacteriophage MS2 and øX174, and the extended nucleotide sequences were then parsed with informational and statistical algorithms. 
These studies illustrated that well known features, such as the coding segments and the triplet code, are revealed in straightforward statistical analyses and were the proof of the concept that bioinformatics would be insightful.[21][22]

In order to study how normal cellular activities are altered in different disease states, raw biological data must be combined to form a comprehensive picture of these activities. 
Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation of various types of data. 
This also includes nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures.[23]

Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include: 
1. Development and implementation of computer programs to efficiently access, manage, and use various types of information.
2. Development of new mathematical algorithms and statistical measures to assess relationships among members of large data sets. 
For example, there are methods to locate a gene within a sequence, to predict protein structure and/or function, and to cluster protein sequences into families of related sequences.
3. The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. 
What sets it apart from other approaches is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to achieve this goal. 
Examples include: pattern recognition, data mining, machine learning algorithms, and visualization. 
Major research efforts in the field include sequence alignment, gene finding, genome assembly, drug design, drug discovery, protein structure alignment, protein structure prediction, prediction of gene expression and protein–protein interactions, genome-wide association studies, the modeling of evolution and cell division/mitosis.

Bioinformatics entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data.
Over the past few decades, rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology. 
Bioinformatics is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes.
Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing DNA and protein sequences, aligning DNA and protein sequences to compare them, and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures.
