Bioinformatics is a rapidly evolving discipline. Students who practice Linux commands
such as grep, sed, awk, sort, uniq, and find gain a strong advantage in data analysis.
Large-scale sequencing projects generate enormous text-based datasets. Skills in 
navigating directories, parsing text files, and automating tasks are essential.
Motifs like ATG, CGT, and TATA appear frequently in genomic data.
Mastering these commands enables efficient data manipulation, pattern recognition,
and extraction of meaningful biological insights from raw data files.
