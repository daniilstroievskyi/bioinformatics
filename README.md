# Introduction to Bioinformatics resources for practicals


## Download Instructions

To download the resources for the bioinformatics practicals, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bioinformatics-resources.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file directly from the GitHub repository page by clicking on the "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP". After downloading, extract the contents to your desired location on your computer.


## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each containing specific resources for the bioinformatics practicals:

- `01_linux/`: Contains files and scripts related to Linux command-line tools used in bioinformatics.

- `02_bioinformatics_tools/`: Contains resources and scripts for various bioinformatics tools and software.

- `03_data_analysis/`: Contains datasets and analysis scripts for bioinformatics data processing.

Each directory includes a README file with detailed instructions on how to use the resources contained within.

Note that large files are not included in this repository due to size constraints. Please refer to the individual README files for instructions on how to obtain any necessary large datasets or files.

**Download these files prior to starting the practicals to ensure you have all necessary resources available and ready to use. Failure to do so will result in being marked as absent!**
