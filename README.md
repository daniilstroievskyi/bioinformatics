## Download Instructions

To download the resources for the bioinformatics practicals, you can download the ZIP file directly from the GitHub repository page by clicking on the "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP". 
After downloading, extract the contents to your desired location on your computer.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository from GitHub.
This is recommended, because new materials and updates will be added throughout the course, and you can easily pull the latest changes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brAInworks-labs/bioinformatics.git
```

Each seminar directory includes a README file with detailed instructions on how to use the resources contained within.
Note that large files are not included in this repository due to size constraints, so refer to the individual README files for instructions on how to obtain any necessary large datasets or files.

**Install all required tools and download the files prior to start of the seminar to ensure you have all necessary resources available and ready to use. Failure to do so will result in being marked as absent!**
